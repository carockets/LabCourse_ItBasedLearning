#Pythonia -- Final report
(*Philip Lenhart, Victor Seifert, Leonhard Hecht, Carola Boettcher -- TU München, Sommersemester 2015*)

[TOC]

##Introduction

 - motivation
 - short introduction to the lab course
 - short intro to the "Schülerakademie"
 - short intro to TUM
 - Why did we decide to do that project in particular?

##What is Pythonia?

###Technical Backgrounds

 - Which tools were used
 - Programming language 
 - frameworks (pygame, etc)
 - grahics, sounds
 - development process
 - do we want to license that -- or make it open source?

###Usability
 
 - How does it work
 - How can students use it and learn how to program
 - Which parts of programming were covered
	 - variables, functions, lists, ...

##Development Process

 - Short summary of how the game was build (maybe weekwise)
 - starting with requiements engineering, getting to know python, web research, ...

##Use of pythonia during a lesson

###Planning of the lesson?

 - what were our goals
 - how did we want to design the lesson

###Student Experiences

 - did the students get the main idea?
 - do we think that their programming knowledge has improved?
 - did they have fun?

###Our Experiences

 - positive (what worked good)
 - negative (at which points did the students encounter problems)

##Conclusion

###"Lessons" learned

 - what can be improved in the furture
 - what would we make different if doing the project again

###Probable enhancements

 - more levels
 - introduction to object orientation
 - 3D
 - ...

##Discussion
- is it a good way to teach programming with a game?
